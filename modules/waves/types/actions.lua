--- Waves' mission vocabulary, declared once for every grammar that names it.
--- The mission kit derives its authoring surface from these types, so the
--- alias and class names here are load-bearing beyond the checker.

--- A wave pack: a flavor module's noun, naming a composition defined once in
--- that module. `name` doubles as the director's name and its savegame key.
---@class WavePackRef
---@field name string "<module>.<pack>", the running director's name
---@field module string the flavor module that can rebuild the spec
---@field pack string which builder inside it

--- Begin's chain. .Against is required — a director with no target has
--- nobody to attack; the rest are dials with sane defaults.
